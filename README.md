# Documents
This is where all related documents will be. We can use it to communicate and guide our implementation.

### Organization
```Requirement Document```: the document is for end users(consumers). It specifies what the project is about, and how it will be look like when we complete it. This will be the our goal. <br>
```Design Document```: Overall design of our project. It specifies components we need to implement, and they work together. Feel free to change and add things.
```Page Design```: UI design of pages served by the web server component

### Change Document
if you guys have any things you want to change or add, feel free to do so. just make sure when commit the change, mention what you add or change. If it is a significant re-write, open a issue might be a good idea, so that we can discuss it.
