Wireframe folder contains wireframe designs. Those are UI design documents that focus 
on the layout without any distraction from detail style such as color, font.  
Those wireframes are created using an online tool called [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/). 
The html files in the wireframe folder are source files for the images with the same file name.  
You can import the html to draw.io and modify the design. Make sure to export to both html file and 
image file when done.  
The pages are based on [issue #3](https://github.com/Wolfie-Home/Documents/issues/3)
